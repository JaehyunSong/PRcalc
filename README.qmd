## Description

  {PRcalc} is an R package that calculates the seat allocation by selecting the highest average methods for the proportional representation system and computes the degree of **disproportionality**. It also enables to calculate the seat allocation by choosing the several methods of seat allocation for territorially defined constituencies and computes the degree of **malapportionment**. Notably, this package can be utilized to decompose $\alpha$-divergence for *inter-* and *intra-*party disproportionality as well as *inter-* and *intra-*state malapportionment.

## Installation

```r
# If {remotes} is not installed, install {remotes} package.
remotes::install_github("JaehyunSong/PRcalc")
