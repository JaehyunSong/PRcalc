{PRcalc} supports two types of data structures---"nested" and "span". This represents the relationship between level 1 and level 2, where level 1 means state or region and level 2 means district or party. For example, if level 1 is state and level 2 is political party, the party would nominate candidates to multiple states. We describe this as "level 2 **span**s level 1". On the other hand, if the constituency is within a state, we call it "level 2 **nested** in level 1". The following figure shows the difference between "nested" and "span" structure. In {PRcalc}, default is `"nestd"`.

## Example 1: Electoral result

```{r}
data("jp_lower_2021_result")

jp_lower_2021_result

obj1 <- as_prcalc(jp_lower_2021_result,
                  l1   = "Pref",
                  l2   = "Party",
                  p    = "Votes",
                  q    = "Seats",
                  type = "span")

plot(obj1, 
     subset_p  = c("Jimin", "Komei", "Rikken", 
                   "Kyosan", "Ishin", "Kokumin"),
     facet_col = 3,
     angle     = 25)
```

## Example 2: Electoral district allocation (from `data.frame`)

```{r}
data("au_district_2010")

au_district_2010

obj2 <- as_prcalc(au_district_2010,
                  l1   = "region",
                  l2   = "district",
                  p    = "electorates",
                  q    = "magnitude",
                  type = "nested")

obj2

decompose(obj2, alpha = 0, as_disprop = FALSE)
```

## Example 3: Electoral district allocation (from `.csv` file)

Sample dataset can be downloaded from [here](../data/sample_dataset.csv).

```{r}
#| error: true
# Because default value of `type` is `"district"`, you can omit it.
obj3 <- read_prcalc("../data/sample_dataset.csv",
                    l1 = "region",
                    l2 = "district",
                    p  = "electorates",
                    q  = "magnitude")

index(obj3)
```

## Example 4: 

```{r}
data("br_district_2010")

head(br_district_2010)

# In Brazil, proportionality is followed as a principle, with the exception that there should be a minimum of eight (8) members and a maximum of seventy (70) members per state. (source: Wikipedia) 
obj4 <- br_district_2010 |> 
  as_prcalc(l1   = "district",
            p    = "population",
            q    = "magnitude",
            type = "span")

obj4

obj5 <- br_district_2010 |> 
  select(-magnitude) |> 
  prcalc(m = 513, method = "hn")

list(obj4, obj5) |> 
  compare() |> 
  plot(angle = 45)

list(index(obj4), index(obj5)) |> 
  compare() |> 
  print(use_gt = TRUE, hide_id = TRUE)
```
