## Preparation

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(PRcalc)
```

## Decomposition

### Using a `prcalc` object.

```{r}
data(jp_lower_2021)

obj1 <- prcalc(jp_lower_2021,
               m = c(8, 13, 19, 22, 17, 11, 21, 28, 11, 6, 20),
               method = "dt")

obj2 <- prcalc(jp_lower_2021,
               m = c(8, 13, 19, 23, 19, 11, 20, 29, 10, 5, 19),
               method = "dt")

obj3 <- prcalc(jp_lower_2021,
               m = c(8, 13, 19, 23, 19, 11, 20, 29, 10, 5, 19),
               method = "msl")

decompose(obj1)
decompose(obj2)
decompose(obj3)
```

Different $\alpha$ also available. Default is 2.

```{r}
decompose(obj1, alpha = 0.5)
decompose(obj1, alpha = 1)
decompose(obj1, alpha = 1.5)
decompose(obj1, alpha = 2)
decompose(obj1, alpha = 3)
```
