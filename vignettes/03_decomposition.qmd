## Preparation

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(PRcalc)

data(jp_lower_2021)

obj1 <- prcalc(jp_lower_2021,
               m = c(8, 13, 19, 22, 17, 11, 21, 28, 11, 6, 20),
               method = "dt")

obj2 <- prcalc(jp_lower_2021,
               m = c(8, 13, 19, 23, 19, 11, 20, 29, 10, 5, 19),
               method = "dt")

obj3 <- prcalc(jp_lower_2021,
               m = c(8, 13, 19, 23, 19, 11, 20, 29, 10, 5, 19),
               method = "msl")
