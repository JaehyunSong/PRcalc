## Description

selecting the highest average methods for the proportional
representation system and computes the degree of **disproportionality**.
It also enables to calculate the seat allocation by choosing the several
methods of seat allocation for territorially defined constituencies and
computes the degree of **malapportionment**. Notably, this package can
be utilized to decompose *Î±*-divergence for *inter-* and *intra-*party
disproportionality as well as *inter-* and *intra-*state
malapportionment.
